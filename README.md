## Strapper

The name of this repository is a tongue-in-cheek reference to [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), the popular HTML framework for "faster and easier web development".

In order to save you a few hours, this repository takes you a few steps further and sets up:

* [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Google Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/)
* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)

Where available, the resources are set up using a combination of [BotstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) and [Google Hosted Libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide). If you find yourself needing to work offline often, you will need to download and set up Font-Awesome and Bootstrap locally.
