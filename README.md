## Strapper

The name of this repository is a tongue-in-cheek reference to [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), the popular HTML framework for "faster and easier web development".

In order to save you a few hours, this repository takes you a few steps further and sets up:

* [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome 4](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Google Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/)
* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)

The resources are linked to using [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com/), which supports http/https/spdy. If you find yourself needing to work offline often, you will need to download and set these resources up locally.
